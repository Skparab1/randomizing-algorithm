# randomizing-algorithm
- Random number generating algorithm

- I've heard that the way computers generate random numbers is not really random, but algorithm based.

- This algorithm does generate varying numbers, but some repeated many times, and some never appear.

- works better for larger number ranges, for small ranges variation is little

- I'm currently working on an algorithm which does not repeat numbers at all

# how it works

- makes a list of all the integers in the given range
- shuffles the list twice using the randomize list algorithm
- picks an algorithm decided number from the list
